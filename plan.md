PLAN:
Complete - Create the HTML elements that we need in order to make a pokemon card
Complete - Style them using CSS into a good format
complete - Use a button to generate a random number that pulls a random pokemon ID and fits it to the template
    make function where random num generated between 1 and 151
    return the random number
    plug into fetch function
    make so button press = run function 
complete - Use JS to pull the info from the pokemon API and place it in the corresponding div
    // reference each element
    // add .innerHTML to each 
complete - take the desired info and add it to the corresponding HTML elemnts using DOM

BONUS:
complete - could add a button to store a card down below if you like it 
complete - Could add an element of random chance whether you catch it or not
Add a limit to the pokeball amount
could add stronger balls with higher chance of catching
Add a way to get balls back?
make catch rate lower with higher hp
