As part of a one-day pair programming challenge at the School of Code, we created a Pokemon app using fetch requests from a API.  

We decided we wanted the users to be able to gerenate a new random Pokemon, throw a Pokeball to catch them and store there catches in an inventory.

As a future project I would like to store the users catches permentaly in a database and provide basic CRUD operations.
