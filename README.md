As part of a one-day pair programming challenge at the School of Code, we created a Pokemon app using fetch requests from a API.  

We decided we wanted the users to be able to gerenate a new random Pokemon, throw a Pokeball to catch them and store there catches in an inventory.

As a future project I would like to store the users catches permentaly in a database and provide basic CRUD operations.


### Pokemon API
- [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/)

## Set-Up
 1. Clone to VS code
 2. Open in browser

## What I learned
- How to mange Fetch Requests using asynchronus functions and awaiting promises.
- Using DOM manipulation
- When to scale back our MVP to complete the project within the 1 day deadline
